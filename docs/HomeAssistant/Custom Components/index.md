The custom components I am using are mainly from HACs or custom GitHub repos imported into HACs.

Looking forward to editing and creating my own.

## Security
Here are the security/surveillance custom components I am using. I haven't edited the YAML but plan on it on the weekends and after work.

### eufy Security

I have several Eufy cams, one in my office, a regular 2K cam, a 2K Pan & Tilt in my living room, and a Battery Doorbell outside.

I love in an apartment so it is imperative that I have a wireless doorbell.

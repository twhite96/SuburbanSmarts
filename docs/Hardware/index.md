I'm currently in the process of migrating my current installation to an Intel NUC I bought a couple months ago.

Since Home Assistant allows you to have multiple server access in the UI, this will allow me to have an easier time accessing a dev server on my Raspberry Pi 4 and the main install on the NUC.
